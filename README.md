##   Project Overview

Welcome to the **Library Management System** project! This project is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** developed using **React** and **React Router**. The application allows users to efficiently manage books, authors, categories, and publishers through a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface.

###   Key Features

This application includes the following pages:
- **Home Page (Welcome Page)**
- **Publisher Page**
- **Category Page**
- **Book Page**
- **Author Page**
- **Borrowing Page**

Each page includes full CRUD operations, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete entries related to publishers, categories, books, authors, and borrowing.

###  CRUD Operations

The application supports the following operations:
- **Create:** Add new entries for publishers, categories, books, authors, and borrowing records.
- **Read:** View details of existing entries for publishers, categories, books, authors, and borrowing records.
- **Update:** Edit existing entries to modify their details.
- **Delete:** Remove entries from the system when necessary.

If a CRUD operation fails, the user will be notified with an appropriate message.

##  Design

For the design of this application, I used **CSS** to provide a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. The layout is simple yet functional, with a focus on usability and accessibility.

###  Technologies Used

This project incorporates the following technologies:
- **Frontend:** React, React Router
- **Backend:** Configured backend (CRUD operations connected to the database)
- **HTTP Requests:** Axios (or any other HTTP client of your choice)

## API Documentation

The backend API can be accessed and tested via **Swagger**. This allows you to interact with the API endpoints and perform CRUD operations directly from the documentation interface. You can fetch and manage data from the backend using **Axios**, or any other HTTP client library you prefer.

The same set of endpoints is available for managing **categories**, **books**, **authors**, and **borrowing**.


###  Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.

### Backend Integration
The backend is pre-configured and ready to handle the required CRUD operations. You can interact with the backend using Axios or any other HTTP client of your choice.

Conclusion
This project showcases a fully functional library management system with React. It provides an interactive interface to manage and organize books, authors, categories, and publishers. The integration with a backend API allows seamless CRUD operations, making this a complete and efficient web application.
